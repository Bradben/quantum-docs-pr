# Quantum Development Kit licensing

The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK) provides an extensive collection of open-source functions and operations, licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
The portions of the standard library that are portable across target machines can be obtained from the [Microsoft/QuantumLibraries](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumLibraries) repository on GitHub, along with other libraries, such as the [quantum chemistry](xref:microsoft.quantum.chemistry.concepts.intro), [quantum machine learning](xref:microsoft.quantum.machine-learning.concepts.intro), and [quantum numerics](xref:microsoft.quantum.numerics.intro) libraries.

The QDK also provides specialized library functions and operations licensed under a [Microsoft Research license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum-NC/blob/main/LICENSE).
These specialized functions and operations can be obtained from the [Microsoft/Quantum-NC](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum-nc) repository on GitHub.

There are also many samples available that explain and illustrate the use of functions and operations from the standard library and other libraries.
These samples are licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and can be obtained from the [Microsoft/Quantum](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum) repository on GitHub.
