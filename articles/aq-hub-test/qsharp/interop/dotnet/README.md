# .NET Interoperability

This sample demonstrates how to use Azure Quantum together with .NET.

## Running the sample on Azure Quantum

Make sure that you have [created and selected a quantum workspace](~/how-to-guides/create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-portal.md), and then run the following at the command line:

```azcli
dotnet run -- --subscription-id <subscription> --resource-group <resource-group> --workspace-name <workspace-name>
```
