Why do we have exponential growth for quantum state vectors?  Our goal in this section is to review the rules used to build multi-qubit states out of single-qubit states as well as discuss the gate operations that we need to include in our gate set to form a universal many-qubit quantum computer.
These tools are absolutely necessary to understand the gate sets that are commonly used in Q# code and also to gain intuition about why quantum effects such as entanglement or interference render quantum computing more powerful than classical computing.

## Representing Two Qubits
The main difference between one- and two-qubit states is that two-qubit states are four dimensional rather than two dimensional.
This is because the computational basis for two-qubit states is formed by the tensor products of one-qubit states.  For example, we have
\begin{align}
00 \equiv \begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\otimes \begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\qquad 01 \equiv \begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\otimes \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\\\\
10 \equiv \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\otimes \begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\qquad 11 \equiv \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\otimes \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
